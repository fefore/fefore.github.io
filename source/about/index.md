Hey y'all, I'm Arvind. I specialize in API design, microservices, SaaS integration, continuous integration and delivery, PaaS and real-time analytics and aything cloud at this stage.

I work on large scale projects in public and private sectors delivering innovative solutions by using a combination of open source software, cloud-native application architectures and thought leadership with a focus on business value.

Apart from the glorious introduction, I'm a huge foodie and living in Melbourne has never ceased to inspire me. I do love Latin music and I have got heaps of latin friends who love food and music (see what I did there). I do heaps hiking over long weekends and enjoy mountain climbing. I've got a few easter eggs all across Australia if you're into GeoCaching.

I do enjoy my occasional gaming duties - Overwatch, CS:GO, COD and open-world games on my dandy consoles.

So I hope you enjoy this blog as I write about my encounters and discoveries in my tech career. As Maya Angelou says

> My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.

P.S - When I get bored, I take pictures. Head on to my profile on [500px](https://500px.com/fefore)
